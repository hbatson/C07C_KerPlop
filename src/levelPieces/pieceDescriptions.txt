1. At least 5 pieces that interact using one of each type of interaction:
	All extend GamePiece
	-Hit: Cannon piece hits player for 1 damage point
	-Kill: Groundhog piece kills player if it is landed on
	-Advance: Ring piece advances player when player lands on it
	-Get_Point: Wizard piece gives the player a point if landed on
	-None: Owl piece does not affect player when interacted with
	
2. At least one piece should interact at a distance:
	Cannon piece interacts with the player if the player comes within three 
	spaces of the piece
	
3. At most 3 pieces can interact only when on the same square
	-Groundhog
	-Ring
	-Wizard
	These are the only three pieces that interact with a player when on
	the same square
	
4. At least two pieces that move. 2 different moving algorithms. 1 random algorithm.
	-Groundhog and Owl both implement Moveable interface and use a random movement
		algorithm
	-Wizard also implements Moveable interface but uses the players location to
		determine when it should move and by how much.
		
5. At least 1 piece should only be Drawable (i.e., not a GamePiece):
	-Tree piece does not extend GamePiece and only implements drawable interface
